# Map Coloring problem
This is a Java implementation for Map Coloring problem and compare the observed results in the context of USA and Australia maps. The methods used are:
1. Depth first search only 
2. Depth first search + forward checking
3. Depth first search + forward checking + propagation through singleton domains
All of the 3 methods are performed on with and without heuristics. The used heuristics are MRV, Degree Constraint, and Least Constraining Value.

# How to run:
1. You need to run the Main.java class (find it in the 'main' directory). It contains the main() method.
2. Wait for the program to execute completely. It might take a while.
